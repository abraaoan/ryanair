# Ryanair Challenge
Swift mvvm with PokeApi

# The Challenge
1. Create a form where the user can make an availability request
2. The form should also include a search button to call the server to retrieve the response and present the results on a list with date, flight number and regular fare

# A little about planning
- First I use Postman to test the request and see the results
- After that I explore how it's works and start think how made a App with it.
- So in the XCode I made a feel layouts based on the results.
- Now I have all I needed to start coding.

# Design Pattern
- The idea it's use MVVM but without reactive programing.
- Beside that I used SOLID principle and DRY.
- And others

# Final toughts
- Was able to put my knowloge in pratice, and had a lot of fun.
- Mainly when I was thinks how to organize the code and layout.
- There are a lot of skill that I want to show, but the time was short.
- That's All, Thanks
